# Duka Moja (Uza App)

## Overview

Duka Moja (Uza App) is a web and mobile application designed for wholesalers and retailers across different consumer and producer goods sectors. The app functions similarly to an e-commerce platform, allowing customers to browse a catalog and place orders. However, unlike standard e-commerce models, sellers have the flexibility to decide whether to offer delivery or require in-store pickup.

The icing on the cake is that clients will have the freedom to opt in and out at will as bailing will be based on usage.
